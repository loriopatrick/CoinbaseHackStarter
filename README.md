## Coinbase Hack Starter

### Getting started

The first thing to do is copy `app_keys_ref.js` to `app_keys.js`. You can do this by running `cp app_keys_ref.js app_keys.js` in this project's directory. After that, generate your api keys at either [Coinbase Sandbox](https://sandbox.coinbase.com) or [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com) and fill in `app_keys.js`. See `index.js` for reference implementation of Coinbase's OAUTH.
